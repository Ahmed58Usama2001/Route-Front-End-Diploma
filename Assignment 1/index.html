                The Portuguese team is considered as one of the best teams in the world especially they joined the
                competition with the best generation in their history. Also having the legend Cristiano Ronaldo for the
                last time as a player in the world cup will be a great motivation to achieve the trophy for the first
                time in thei history.

                The French team is the last trophy winner and they came to Qatar wanting to keep the world cup in
                France. Despite the injuries that striked the team before and during the competition, France is still
                doing very well in their matches. They are a hard oponnent for any other team.

                Netherland have the record of reaching the final of the cup then not winning it. Can they reach the
                final and beat the bad luck in this world cup?
                With an limited generation their chances are very low but the name of Netherland and with their coach
                Louis Van Gaal they still has a chance.

                most Baloon D`oor winner. In his last world cup in his career he is trying to achieve the trophy with
                the help of young players whom are seeking for honouring Messi with the World cup.
